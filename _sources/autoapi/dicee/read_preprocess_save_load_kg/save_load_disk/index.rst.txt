.. py:class:: LoadSaveToDisk(kg)


   Handle the saving and loading of a knowledge graph to and from disk.

   This class provides functionality to serialize and deserialize the components of a knowledge graph,
   such as entity and relation indices, datasets, and byte-pair encoding mappings, to and from disk storage.

   .. attribute:: kg

      An instance of the knowledge graph to be saved or loaded.

      :type: object

   .. method:: save() -> None

      Save the knowledge graph components to disk.


   .. method:: load() -> None

      Load the knowledge graph components from disk.


   .. py:method:: save()

      Save the knowledge graph components to disk.

      This method serializes various components of the knowledge graph such as entity and relation indices,
      datasets, and byte-pair encoding mappings, and saves them to the specified file paths in the knowledge
      graph instance. The method handles different data types and structures based on the configuration of
      the knowledge graph.

      :param None:

      :rtype: None

      :raises AssertionError: If the path for serialization is not set or other required conditions are not met.

      .. rubric:: Notes

      - The method checks if the 'path_for_serialization' attribute is set in the knowledge graph instance.
      - Depending on the configuration (e.g., whether byte-pair encoding is used), different components are saved.
      - The method uses custom functions like 'save_pickle' and 'save_numpy_ndarray' for serialization.


   .. py:method:: load()

      Load the knowledge graph components from disk.

      This method deserializes various components of the knowledge graph such as entity and relation indices,
      datasets, and byte-pair encoding mappings from the specified file paths in the knowledge graph instance.
      The method reconstructs the knowledge graph instance with the loaded data.

      :param None:

      :rtype: None

      :raises AssertionError: If the path for deserialization is not set or other required conditions are not met.

      .. rubric:: Notes

      - The method checks if the 'path_for_deserialization' attribute is set in the knowledge graph instance.
      - The method updates the knowledge graph instance with the loaded components.
      - The method uses custom functions like 'load_pickle' and 'load_numpy_ndarray' for deserialization.
      - If evaluation models are used, additional components like vocabularies and constraints are also loaded.
